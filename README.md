# DL_CNN_Model_to_detect_cancer
build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in tensorflow. 
Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and 
all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
